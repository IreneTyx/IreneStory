The show into the wood was performed at our schoolâ€™s theater last week. Lydia, my roommate, was excited to watch the show. We had lunch together that day. After lunch, I went to College library to work on my p2 program, and she went to the theater. One hour later she came over to the library. Showed me the brochure of the show, ishe told me the ending was so good that every character had a good ending. Later she talked about the storyline with another friend who also watched the show. Surprisingly, they watched the same show but got totally different endings. Until then, Lydia realized that she only watched the prologue and the first act of the show.

Lydia felt she had missed a lot and really hope to have the chance watching the entire show or at least know the true story. Maybe she could find the movie she thought. 

On her way home from College, she began to reflect on whether or not she should go through with her desire to watch the show. She was so troubled that she could no longer work on her P2 program, for she was too distracted by her curious about the show. Once she got back home, she opened up her computer with excitement, eager to look for any available showings. Much to her diappointment however, she was met with some disappointing news.

The show would open until Sunday, but there were no tickets that she could get.

But she had to finish her work to write a summary of the show. Fortunately, she found a full version movie on YouTube. Fianlly, she watched the complete movie and knew the whole story. To her surprise, the show had a bad ending instead of a good ending. If I did not watch the endings, characters can still have happiness in my mind at least, Lydia thought.
