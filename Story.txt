The show into the wood was performed at our schoolâ€™s theater last week. Lydia, my roommate, was excited to watch the show. We had lunch together that day. After lunch, I went to College library to work on my p2 program, and she went to the theater. One hour later she came over to the library. Showed me the brochure of the show, she told me the ending was so good that every character had a good ending. Later she talked about the storyline with another friend who also watched the show. Surprisingly, they watched the same show but got totally different endings. Until then, Lydia realized that she only watched the prologue and the first act of the show.
